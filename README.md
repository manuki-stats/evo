Evolution game

Rules: the simulation starts with 4 different groups of equal size (n, taken as input).

Each group represents a species with specific bonus points in one of four variables (columns 1:4).

Units compete for food during the day, and they breed and mutate during the night.

They die if they get too hungry (hunger==2). Bonus points are hereditary.
